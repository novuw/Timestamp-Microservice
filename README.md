# TimeStamp Microservice
=================
## Allows you to return both Natural and Unix times. To do so, simply write the time you would like to parse as a path on the url.
### For example:
**https://timestampnode.glitch.me/1450137600**
Would return:
**{ "unix": 1450137600, "natural": "December 15, 2015" }**
Enjoy!

This is the first of my FCC backend projects.
